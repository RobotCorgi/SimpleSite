# SimpleSite
Hello world, and hello to the human who is reading this!
This repository is for an assignment during the first week of an Advanced Web Projects class. It features a simple, static website that uses GitHub as a repository for the assignment. This project was made with love and coffee... lots of coffee. Oh, and now this is made with VS Code, so now this repository has 100% more locally-sourced file goodness. 

Beep, boop, bark.
 
Yours truly,

RobotCorgi
