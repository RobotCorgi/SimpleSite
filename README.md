# SimpleSite
Hello world, and hello to the human who is reading this!
This repository is for an assignment during the first week of an Advanced Web Projects class. It features a simple, static website that uses GitHub as a repository for the assignment. 

## Local Files Syncing with Git
Oh, and now this is made with VS Code, so now this repository has 100% more locally-sourced file goodness. 

## Project Dependencies
This project was made with love and coffee... lots of coffee. Homebrew, too.

## Mistakes Were Made... and Will Continue to be Made
More things will end up broken, but hopefully will be fixed. 

### Example Mistakes Made
- Commit-ment to Better Quality Commits
This Robotic Corgi is comitted to making meaningful commits when things are fixed. 
Also, more articles will be read on how to write better commits.

- Now commits will have 50 characters, not 50 words 
Whoops. Sorry about the previous long commits.

- Syncing Issues
Git and GitHub should now sync via VS Code, and not just locally... hopefully.

### Buttons Have Been Pushed and Will Continue to be Pushed Randomly
More exploring of VS Code and GitHub will occur. Usually this involves a completely un-scientific random button pressing and seeing what happens. This type of process is then repeated again and again. Sometimes things break as a result. What things will break? What things will work? I won't know... yet! But I'll keep on trying anyways and seeing what happens. Sometimes, once in a while, they just work right, and it's a beautiful thing. 


Beep, boop, bark.
 
Yours truly,

RobotCorgi
