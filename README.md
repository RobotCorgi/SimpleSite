Hello world, and hello to the human who is reading this!
This repository is for an assignment during the first week of an Advanced Web Projects class. It features a simple, static website that uses GitHub as a repository for the assignment. This project was made with love and coffee... lots of coffee.

Beep, boop, bark.
 
Yours truly, RobotCorgi
